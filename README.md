## Description

This is my personal site using create-react-app on the front end and python's flask on the backend. It is hosted on heroku at https://blake-spencer-projects.herokuapp.com/classification. You can see the github for the frontend here: https://github.com/blakespencer/personal-site-frontend

I hope you enjoy the site
